# Employee summary

## Description
This project is an assignent from the UCF full stack coding program to focus on node.js inquirer, and the process of creating an app. I coded the const functions "Employee", "Manager", "Engineer", and "Intern", to make a local directory of teh employee database. This is a lesson in learning how and why to use the node modules js and get more knowledge in the back end developing. In the app file is the inquirer code I wrote to ask the proper questions for the center log to display the prompted answers that were asked in the js file with the answers that are prompted fromthe app.js file. The "Employee". js file required a class "Employe" and a constucter  as the parent file for the subsequent employees. I did some similar things with the manager and intern files as well. I ran tests multiple times through out the process. At the beginning i was getting a bunch of erros and ran into some very difficult problms. BUt thanks to the study group and the class in general I was able to get through with time to spare. I am grateful to have completed this project as it is one of the ost challenging things I ahve ever done academically.
